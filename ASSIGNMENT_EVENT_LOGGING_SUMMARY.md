## üìä Controller Integration

### Example: Department Assignment

```javascript
// In assetAssignmentController.js
const deptAssignmentLogger = require("../eventLoggers/deptAssignmentEventLogger");

const addAssetAssignment = async (req, res) => {
    const startTime = Date.now();
    const userId = req.user?.user_id;
    
    try {
        // Log assignment initiated
        await deptAssignmentLogger.logDeptAssignmentInitiated({
            assetId: asset_id,
            deptId: dept_id,
            orgId: org_id,
            userId
        });

        // ... validation logic ...

        // Insert assignment
        const result = await model.insertAssetAssignment(assignmentData);

        // Log success
        await deptAssignmentLogger.logDeptAssignmentSuccess({
            assetId: asset_id,
            deptId: dept_id,
            assignmentId: asset_assign_id,
            userId,
            duration: Date.now() - startTime
        });

        res.status(201).json({ ... });

    } catch (err) {
        // Log error
        await deptAssignmentLogger.logAssignmentError({
            assetId: req.body?.asset_id,
            deptId: req.body?.dept_id,
            error: err,
            userId,
            duration: Date.now() - startTime
        });
        res.status(500).json({ error: err });
    }
};
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Integration

### Asset Selection Screen

The asset-selection screen (`/asset-selection`) is a **common screen** used by both flows:

```javascript
// AssetSelection.jsx
const appId = entityType === 'employee' ? EMP_ASSIGNMENT_APP_ID : DEPT_ASSIGNMENT_APP_ID;
const { recordActionByNameWithFetch } = useAuditLog(appId);

// When asset is assigned
await recordActionByNameWithFetch('Assign', {
    assetId: asset.asset_id,
    [entityType === 'employee' ? 'employeeId' : 'deptId']: entityId,
    action: `Asset Assigned to ${entityType === 'employee' ? 'Employee' : 'Department'}`
});
```

### Navigation Context

When navigating to asset-selection:

**From Department Assignment:**
```javascript
navigate('/asset-selection', {
    state: {
        entityId: selectedDept,
        entityType: 'department'
    }
});
// Logs to: events_DEPTASSIGNMENT_YYYY-MM-DD.csv
```

**From Employee Assignment:**
```javascript
navigate('/asset-selection', {
    state: {
        entityId: selectedEmployee,
        entityIntId: selectedEmployeeIntId,
        entityType: 'employee',
        departmentId: selectedDepartment
    }
});
// Logs to: events_EMPASSIGNMENT_YYYY-MM-DD.csv
```

3. **Comprehensive**: All operations from initiation to completion are logged
4. **Detailed**: Includes asset IDs, department/employee IDs, duration, and user info
5. **Consistent**: Follows same pattern as ASSETS and REPORTS logging
6. **Debuggable**: Easy to trace issues with detailed request/response data

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add bulk assignment logging
- [ ] Add asset transfer logging (department to employee, or vice versa)
- [ ] Add assignment approval workflow logging
- [ ] Add assignment notification logging
- [ ] Add assignment report generation logging
