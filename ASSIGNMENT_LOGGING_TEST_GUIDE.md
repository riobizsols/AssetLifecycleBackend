## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Backend running**: `npm start` or `pm2 start ecosystem.config.js`
2. **Frontend running**: Navigate to the application
3. **Database configured**: Ensure database connection is working
4. **User logged in**: You need to be authenticated
5. **Test data available**:
   - At least one department
   - At least one employee
   - At least one inactive asset available for assignment

## üóÇÔ∏è Log File Locations

After running tests, check these files in the `logs/events/` directory:

```
logs/events/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ events_DEPTASSIGNMENT_2025-10-22.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ events_EMPASSIGNMENT_2025-10-22.csv

## üîç How to Verify Logs

### Method 1: Using CSV Viewer/Excel
1. Navigate to `AssetLifecycleBackend/logs/events/`
2. Open `events_DEPTASSIGNMENT_2025-10-22.csv` (use today's date)
3. Open `events_EMPASSIGNMENT_2025-10-22.csv` (use today's date)
4. Verify entries match your test actions

### Method 2: Using Terminal (Windows PowerShell)
```powershell
# View latest department assignment logs
Get-Content -Path "logs/events/events_DEPTASSIGNMENT_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd').csv" -Tail 20

# View latest employee assignment logs
Get-Content -Path "logs/events/events_EMPASSIGNMENT_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd').csv" -Tail 20

# Search for specific asset
Select-String -Path "logs/events/events_DEPTASSIGNMENT_*.csv" -Pattern "A001"

# Count events by level
(Get-Content "logs/events/events_EMPASSIGNMENT_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd').csv" | Select-String -Pattern ",INFO,").Count
```

### Method 3: Using Node.js Script
Create a test script to read and parse logs:

```javascript
// testAssignmentLogs.js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
const deptLogFile = path.join(__dirname, 'logs', 'events', `events_DEPTASSIGNMENT_${today}.csv`);
const empLogFile = path.join(__dirname, 'logs', 'events', `events_EMPASSIGNMENT_${today}.csv`);

console.log('üìã Department Assignment Logs:');
if (fs.existsSync(deptLogFile)) {
    const content = fs.readFileSync(deptLogFile, 'utf-8');
    const lines = content.split('\n');
    console.log(`Total entries: ${lines.length - 1}`); // -1 for header
    console.log('\nLast 5 entries:');
    console.log(lines.slice(-5).join('\n'));
} else {
    console.log('‚ùå No log file found for today');
}

console.log('\nüìã Employee Assignment Logs:');
if (fs.existsSync(empLogFile)) {
    const content = fs.readFileSync(empLogFile, 'utf-8');
    const lines = content.split('\n');
    console.log(`Total entries: ${lines.length - 1}`);
    console.log('\nLast 5 entries:');
    console.log(lines.slice(-5).join('\n'));
} else {
    console.log('‚ùå No log file found for today');
}
```

Run with: `node testAssignmentLogs.js`

## üêõ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: CSV file not created
**Solution**: 
- Check if `logs/events/` directory exists
- Check file permissions
- Verify backend is running
- Check console for errors

### Issue 2: Logs appear in wrong CSV file
**Solution**:
- Verify `entityType` is correctly passed from frontend
- Check that correct event logger is being used in controller
- Verify appId in event logger files

### Issue 3: Missing data in logs
**Solution**:
- Check that all required parameters are being passed to logging functions
- Verify request body contains necessary data
- Check for null/undefined values

### Issue 4: Duration is always null
**Solution**:
- Verify `startTime` is captured at the beginning of function
- Ensure `Date.now() - startTime` is calculated before logging
- Check that duration parameter is being passed

## üìä Expected Log Patterns

### Normal Flow (All INFO)
```
ASSIGNMENT_INITIATED ‚Üí ASSIGNMENT_SUCCESS ‚Üí ASSIGNMENTS_VIEW
```

### Assignment with Filtering
```
FILTER_APPLIED ‚Üí ASSETS_VIEW ‚Üí ASSIGNMENT_INITIATED ‚Üí ASSIGNMENT_SUCCESS
```

### Failed Assignment
```
ASSIGNMENT_INITIATED ‚Üí VALIDATION_ERROR (WARNING) ‚Üí Assignment fails
```

### Unassignment Flow
```
ASSIGNMENTS_VIEW ‚Üí UNASSIGNMENT_INITIATED ‚Üí UNASSIGNMENT_SUCCESS
```
