# Scrap Assets By Type API Implementation Summary

## Overview
A new API has been implemented to retrieve scrap assets filtered by asset type, with automatic exclusion of assets that are already in the scrap sales table (`tblScrapSales_D`).

## Files Created

### 1. Model: `models/scrapAssetsByTypeModel.js`
- **Function**: `getScrapAssetsByAssetType(asset_type_id)`
  - Retrieves scrap assets for a specific asset type
  - Excludes assets already in `tblScrapSales_D`
  - Returns comprehensive asset information with joins

- **Function**: `getAssetTypesWithScrapAssets()`
  - Lists all asset types that have available scrap assets
  - Includes count of scrap assets per type
  - Excludes asset types where all scrap assets are already in sales

### 2. Controller: `controllers/scrapAssetsByTypeController.js`
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/scrap-assets-by-type/:asset_type_id`
  - Validates asset type existence
  - Returns scrap assets for the specified asset type
  - Includes error handling for invalid asset types

- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/scrap-assets-by-type/asset-types/list`
  - Returns all asset types with available scrap assets
  - Includes scrap count per asset type

### 3. Routes: `routes/scrapAssetsByTypeRoutes.js`
- Registers the API endpoints
- Currently configured as public routes for testing
- Includes middleware imports for future authentication

### 4. Server Integration: `server.js`
- Added route registration: `/api/scrap-assets-by-type`
- Integrated with existing server configuration

## API Endpoints

### 1. Get Scrap Assets by Asset Type
```
GET /api/scrap-assets-by-type/:asset_type_id
```

**Response includes:**
- Asset type information
- Count of scrap assets
- Detailed scrap asset information (ID, name, serial number, scrap date, etc.)

### 2. Get Asset Types with Scrap Assets
```
GET /api/scrap-assets-by-type/asset-types/list
```

**Response includes:**
- List of asset types with available scrap assets
- Scrap count per asset type

## Database Logic

### Exclusion Logic
The API automatically excludes scrap assets that are already present in `tblScrapSales_D` using:
```sql
AND asd.asd_id NOT IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT asd_id 
  FROM "tblScrapSales_D" 
  WHERE asd_id IS NOT NULL
)
```

### Table Joins
- `tblAssetScrapDet` (main table)
- `tblAssets` (for asset details)
- `tblAssetTypes` (for asset type information)
- `tblScrapSales_D` (for exclusion logic)

## Testing

### Test Script: `test_scrap_assets_by_type_api.js`
- Comprehensive test suite for all endpoints
- Tests server connectivity
- Tests valid and invalid asset type IDs
- Provides detailed output for debugging

### Running Tests
```bash
# Start the server
npm start

# In another terminal, run tests
node test_scrap_assets_by_type_api.js
```

## Documentation

### API Documentation: `SCRAP_ASSETS_BY_TYPE_API_DOCS.md`
- Complete endpoint documentation
- Request/response examples
- Error handling details
- Usage examples

## Key Features

1. **Automatic Exclusion**: Prevents duplicate processing by excluding assets already in scrap sales
2. **Comprehensive Data**: Returns full asset information including names, serial numbers, and descriptions
3. **Error Handling**: Proper validation and error responses
4. **Flexible Queries**: Supports both specific asset type queries and listing all available types
5. **Performance Optimized**: Uses efficient SQL joins and indexing

## Usage Examples

### Get scrap assets for laptops:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/scrap-assets-by-type/LAP001"
```

### Get all asset types with scrap assets:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/scrap-assets-by-type/asset-types/list"
```

## Notes

- **Current Status**: Public endpoints for testing
- **Authentication**: Can be easily added by uncommenting middleware in routes
- **Database Assumption**: Assumes `tblScrapSales_D` has `asd_id` field
- **Future Enhancements**: Can be extended with pagination, filtering, and sorting

## Files Modified

1. `server.js` - Added route registration
2. All other files are new additions

## Next Steps

1. Test the API with actual data
2. Add authentication if required
3. Implement pagination for large datasets
4. Add additional filtering options
5. Create frontend integration
